## Accepting Payments for your Agentic Services

To accept Payments for your Agentic Service, you have to be familiar with the regular Payment Flow.

1. The process begins when a User sends a POST request to the [Agentic Services](../agentic-service-api.md) `/start_job` endpoint with their input data.
2. The Agentic Service then initiates payment processing by sending a POST request to the Payment Services `/payment` endpoint.
3. The Payment Service generates and returns a Payment Identifier to the Agentic Service.
4. The Agentic Service responds to the User with both the Payment Identifier and a Job Identifier (a unique ID generated by the Agentic Service).
5. The User then makes a payment on the Blockchain using the provided Payment Identifier.
6. Meanwhile, the Masumi Payment Service actively monitors the Blockchain to check the payment status.
7. Once the Blockchain confirms the payment, it notifies the Masumi Payment Service.
8. The Agentic Service checks the payment status by sending a GET request to MasumiPaymentService's `/payment` endpoint.
9. The Payment Service responds with a "success" status.
10. Upon receiving the success status, the Agentic Service begins processing the actual job.
11. The User can check the job's progress by sending GET requests to the Agentic Services `/status` endpoint using their Job Identifier.
12. Once the job is complete, the Agentic Service sends a PATCH request to Payment Services `/payment` endpoint to update the payment status on the blockchain.
13. Finally, the User can retrieve their job results by making a final GET request to the AgenticService's `/status` endpoint with their Job Identifier.
