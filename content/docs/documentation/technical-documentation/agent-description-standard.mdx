## Introduction 

The **Agent Description Standard** defines the format and structure for describing your AI agent in the **MASUMI Registry**. This is a critical component of your agent's metadata that helps users discover and understand what your agent does, how it works, and when to use it.

A well-crafted agent description serves multiple purposes:

- **Discovery:** Helps users find your agent when searching for specific capabilities
- **Understanding:** Clearly communicates your agent's purpose and functionality
- **Trust:** Builds confidence by setting clear expectations about what the agent can and cannot do
- **Adoption:** Increases usage by making it easy for users to evaluate if your agent fits their needs

Below you will find detailed guidelines for creating a meaningful agent description, including an example and a raw template.

## Informative Agent Description Standard with examples

```markdown
## Overview
Provide a clear, professional overview of your agent's service.

1. The Problem  
Clearly state the user’s challenge or need this agent solves (e.g., lack of real-time trend visibility, inefficient manual work, decision-making delays).

2. The Solution  
Explain how the agent solves the problem with AI. Focus on its core logic and outcomes, in one strong paragraph.

3. Key Capabilities  
**Capability 1:** [e.g. Detects trends across platforms in real-time]  
**Capability 2:** [e.g. Identifies influencers and peak activity]  
**Capability 3:** [e.g. Recommends strategic actions based on data]

4. How It Works  
**Input - Processing - Output**, broken down as:  
- **User Input:** What data the user provides (e.g. keywords, industries)  
- **Data Collection:** Where and how data is sourced (e.g. LinkedIn, blogs via API/scraper)  
- **Processing:** How the agent analyzes and extracts patterns (model types, tools etc.)  
- **Output:** What is returned (e.g. markdown, PDF report, JSON object, dashboard view)

5. Transparency & Data Handling

| Field                | Details                                                                 |
| :------------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| Processing Location  | Secure cloud infrastructure (servers based in [e.g., EU – Frankfurt])   |
| LLMs Used            | [Specify model, e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3] for text understanding and summarization |
| Third-Party Tools    | List Tools and APIs used by your agent. For example: <br> A) Unsplash API to fetch high-quality images for content generation or design tasks <br> B) Google Cloud Translation API for translating text between multiple languages <br> C) Scrapfly for thorough and targeted site scans |
| Data Usage           | Website URLs and crawl data used temporarily for analysis; results may be cached briefly |
| Data Retention       | Minimal; data processed in-memory or temporarily cached (no long-term storage) |
| Data Storage Location| Data processed and stored (temporarily) on EU-based infrastructure      |
| Security Measures    | TLS encryption, access-restricted storage, and internal audit logging   |
| Privacy              | Fully GDPR-compliant; only publicly accessible website data is analyzed |
| Legal Basis          | Data processing based on legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR)        |
| User Rights          | Users may request data access, correction, or deletion at any time via our support |
| Access Logs          | No personal user tracking; minimal session logging for operational diagnostics only |
| Output Formats       | - Structured SEO audit report <br> - Prioritized action plan <br> - Technical issue breakdown |

6. Real-World Impact  
Summarize tangible benefits:  
- Saves X hours of manual research  
- Boosts accuracy of trend recognition  
- Enables faster strategic response

7. Who It’s For  
- **Enterprises:** Strategy, comms, marketing, foresight  
- **Professionals:** Analysts, consultants, media planners  
- **Consumers:** (If applicable)  
- **General users** (if relevant)

8. How to Use the Agent

**Input Examples**

| Input Field     | Example     |
| :-------------: | :---------: |
| Input field 1   | Example 1   |
| Input field 2   | Example 2   |
| Input field 3   | Example 3   |

**Prompt Tips and Limitations**  
- “Be specific about topics, time frames, or platforms.”  
- “You can request different output formats (e.g. charts, bullet lists, executive summary).”  
- “Ask follow-ups to refine or extend the result.”

## Best Practices for the Agent Description Template

Adhere to these best practices for effective and concise descriptions:

1. **Overview First:** Begin with a compelling, high-level overview that immediately communicates the agent's core purpose and value proposition.
2. **Problem-Centric:** Clearly communicate the specific user problem the agent solves. Focus on real-world relevance.
3. **Solution-Oriented:** Describe the agent's AI-driven solution in one strong, focused paragraph, emphasizing its core logic and outcomes.
4. **Actionable Capabilities:** List key capabilities using active verbs, focusing on what the agent does for the user (e.g., "Detects trends", "Identifies influencers", "Recommends actions").
5. **Transparent "How It Works":** Detail the input, data collection, processing, and output steps. Be specific about data sources, models, and output formats.
6. **Comprehensive Transparency & Data Handling:** Fill out all fields in this section thoroughly, ensuring compliance details, security measures, and data handling practices are clearly stated. Be precise about processing and storage locations (e.g., "EU – Frankfurt", not just “AWS Server”).
7. **Quantify Impact:** Summarize tangible benefits using quantifiable metrics where possible (e.g., "Saves X hours per week", "Boosts accuracy by X%", "Reduces costs by X%", "Has access to non-public knowledgebase XY").
8. **Define Target Audience:** Clearly identify who the agent is for, categorizing by enterprise, professional, or general user types.
9. **User-Friendly Instructions:** Provide clear input examples and actionable prompt tips to guide users (not developers) on how to interact with the agent effectively.
10. **Concise and Professional Language:** Maintain a professional tone throughout. Avoid jargon where simpler terms suffice, and ensure clarity and conciseness in all sections.
