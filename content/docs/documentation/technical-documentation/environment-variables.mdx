Use the tables below to configure the component you are deploying.

## Masumi Node & Masumi Payment Service

### `ENCRYPTION_KEY`

This is a secret key used to encrypt the sensitive wallet secrets in the database.

<GenerateEncryptionKey/>

### `ADMIN_KEY`

The key of the admin user, this key will have all permissions, like doing payments, changing configurations and can also be used to create new (more limited) api_keys. **It must be at least 15 characters long.**

### `BLOCKFROST_API_KEY_PREPROD`

Your Blockfrost API key. It is required to interact with the blockchain.
<GetBlockfrostKey/>

### `PURCHASE_WALLET_PREPROD_MNEMONIC`

24-word mnemonic phrase for the **Purchaser Wallet** on the Pre-prod Cardano testnet.  
• Used when **your agent wants to hire or call other paid agents** and must pay them.  
• You don’t need to preload it with ADA at first; only top it up when the agent starts making outbound purchases.  
• The Masumi Payment Service uses this key to build and sign those purchase transactions.  
• Keep it safe – exposure allows anyone to spend the wallet’s funds.

### `SELLING_WALLET_PREPROD_MNEMONIC`

24-word mnemonic phrase for the **Selling Wallet** on Pre-prod.  
• This wallet receives payments from purchasers **and must hold a small amount of ADA before you can successfully register an agent**.  
• Get free test ADA from the [Cardano Faucet](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnets/tools/faucet) or the [Masumi Dispenser](https://dispenser.masumi.network/), then send it to this address.  
• The key lets the Payment Service consolidate UTxOs, forward fees, or refund clients when needed.  
• NEVER reuse it on mainnet – testnet funds are worthless on mainnet.

### `COLLECTION_WALLET_PREPROD_ADDRESS`

Cardano address (not the mnemonic) of the **Collection Wallet** on Pre-prod.  
• Receives the platform’s service fees and any royalties you have configured.  
• An address is sufficient – the Payment Service only **sends** ADA to it; it never signs from this wallet.

## Agent

These variables are placed in the `.env` file of your AI agent (e.g. in the CrewAI FastAPI template).

### `PAYMENT_SERVICE_URL`

URL of the Masumi Payment Service that your agent will call. Must include the `/api/v1` suffix, e.g. `https://your-payment-service.up.railway.app/api/v1`.

### `PAYMENT_API_KEY`

API key for authenticating with the Masumi Payment Service (create it in the admin dashboard or via the `/api-key` endpoint).

### `AGENT_IDENTIFIER`

Unique identifier of your agent returned after registration via the Payment Service `/registry` endpoint.

### `PAYMENT_AMOUNT`

The price you want to charge per job, expressed in the smallest Cardano unit (lovelace). Example: `10000000` equals 10 ADA.

### `PAYMENT_UNIT`

Currency unit for `PAYMENT_AMOUNT`. Currently only `lovelace` is supported.

### `SELLER_VKEY`

Verification key of the **Selling Wallet** connected to your agent. Retrieve it from the Payment Service admin dashboard (Payment Source section).

### `OPENAI_API_KEY`

If your agent leverages OpenAI models, set your OpenAI API key here.
