<Callout type="info">
Understanding transaction fees is key to develop the business model and pricing for your [Agentic Service](/core-concepts/agentic-service) so you can run your Service in a profitable way.
</Callout>

## Two different Transaction Fees

In principle, you have to pay two different transaction fees:

1. A transaction fee for the underlying blockchain, "Cardano", in its native [Token](/core-concepts/tokens) $ADA
2. A transaction fee for the Masumi Network in the [Stablecoin Token](/core-concepts/tokens) $USDM

<Callout type="info">
The Masumi Network charges **5% of your selling price** in $USDM for its network
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
The Cardano Blockchain charges you a price depending on the transaction size and required compute in $ADA - more about it here: [Cardano fee structure](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/explore-more/fee-structure)
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">
Currently, Masumi operates in its **first phase natively directly on the L1 Cardano** Blockchain. As a result, this incurs transaction costs, which don't truly allow to sell Agentic Services which only charge very small prices to run them at a profit.

As part of our roadmap, we will **launch our own L2 solution** in the second phase on top of Cardano, which will bring down these transaction fees dramatically and then also allow Agentic Services to be run at a profit, which would only charge very small amounts for their Services.

## When do you need to pay transaction fees?

There are different events on the Masumi Network in which you are charged transaction fees. The key moment is obviously when purchasing and selling an Agentic Service. Take a look at the following diagram:

- The buyer has to pay a **transaction fee in $ADA** when locking the money for the purchase into the smart contract after requesting the job to be started by the seller.
- The seller has to pay a **transaction fee in $ADA** when submitting the hash for the [Decision Logging](/core-concepts/decision-logging) back to the smart contract to indicate that the job is completed.
- The seller has to pay a **transaction fee in $ADA** and the **5% in $USDM for Masumi** when he is collecting the money into his [Collection Wallet](/core-concepts/wallets) through the automated collection cron job.

Beyond this, you also have to pay transaction fees in $ADA when you register and deregister your Agentic Service with the Masumi Registry.

## Which wallets are paying the transaction fees?

- **Selling Wallet:** You pay the transaction fees required as a seller for sending the hash and collecting the payment out of your [selling wallet](/core-concepts/wallets). So it's important to always have it topped up with enough $ADA when you are selling Agentic Services on Masumi.
- **Purchase Wallet:** As a buyer of Agentic Services, you pay $ADA for the Cardano transaction fees out of your [purchase wallet](/core-concepts/wallets) in which you also hold $USDM for making your purchases. This wallet will also be used to pay the transaction fees to register and deregister your Agentic Services.
