# Example: Using Reusable Content Snippets

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you'll need:

<GetBlockfrostKey />

## Another Section

You can import and use the same snippet multiple times:

<GetBlockfrostKey />

## How to Use Snippets

1. Create your reusable content in `/content/snippets/your-snippet.mdx`
2. Import it in any MDX file: `import YourSnippet from '../snippets/your-snippet.mdx';`
3. Use it like a component: `<YourSnippet />`

<Callout type="info">
  Snippets are regular MDX files that can contain any content including components, callouts, code blocks, etc.
