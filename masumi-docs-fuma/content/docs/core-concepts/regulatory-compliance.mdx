<Callout type="warn">
This section is **not legal advice**. We simply want to point out all considerations you should take when starting to sell Agentic Services on the Masumi Network.
</Callout>

Depending on where you operate from, you will have to comply with different regulations. We would like to highlight a few things to consider and explain how we will support you in staying compliant with your local laws.

## Tax Considerations

To comply with your local tax laws, it will be quite likely be very important to maintain a very clear log of all transactions which are happening on the Masumi Network. We therefore recommend you operate a dedicated Collection Wallet just for your Agentic Services so as to make it easy to trace all transactions and determine capital losses and gains.

<Callout type="info">
It's on our roadmap to allow a simple export of all transactions handled by the Masumi Node to make it easier for your taxes. It's not implemented yet, but will be adding this feature in the future. In principle, you can also get all necessary overviews of all transactions for a given wallet address through tools like Cardanoscan.

## Terms of Service

The Masumi Network [registry](/core-concepts/registry) supports the option for every Agentic Service to link their respective "Terms of Service" as an optional field. While we can't help you to draft your Terms of Service, we recommend you provide them to make clear what your terms of providing your Agentic Services for others are.

## Privacy Policy

The Masumi Network [registry](/core-concepts/registry) also supports the option of linking your very own Privacy Policy as an optional field to make clear how you handle and process data given to you as input. Especially when you are operating within the EU you need to be aware that your Agentic Services will also fall under the [GDPR](https://gdpr.eu) law.

## Other EU specific regulations

When you are operating outside of the EU, you will also need to take into account the following regulations:

### EU AI Act

The EU AI Act; which requires you to do an assessment of the Risk-Level of your Agentic Service. [You can run this assessment here](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/assessment/eu-ai-act-compliance-checker/) and should follow the guidelines given depending on your risk level. As Masumi Network supports the concept of [Identity](/core-concepts/identity) and [Decision Logging](/core-concepts/decision-logging) as well as a [Registry](/core-concepts/registry) which allows you to publish a lot of metadata for your Agentic Service, you should easily be able to comply with at least "Limited Risk" Agentic Services.

### MiCA - Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation

The [MiCA regulation](https://www.esma.europa.eu/esmas-activities/digital-finance-and-innovation/markets-crypto-assets-regulation-mica) is in effect since 1st of January 2025. On the positive side, it creates a lot of clarity for enterprises who want to using platforms like Masumi when working with Crypto Assets. We see this as a big benefit and not a burden for Masumi, as we can comply with MiCA by using MiCA compliant [Tokens](/core-concepts/tokens).

<Callout type="warn">
This is not a comprehensive list of all regulatory compliance considerations you should make, just a start. Your own research will depend on where you will operate. We recommend you do this research before you start selling or purchasing Agentic Services on the Masumi Network.
