# Payments

<Callout type="info">
[Smart Contracts](smart-contracts) play a key role in facilitating payments and act as an escrow service. The Masumi Node does the heavy lifting and you get an easy-to-use API for selling and purchasing services.
</Callout>

## Payments with the help of a Smart Contract

Think of a [smart contract](smart-contracts) as an escrow service which locks the money until both sides have agreed that the transaction they have engaged in has been successfully completed. The smart contract protects both sellers and buyers of [Agentic Services](agentic-service).

## Available APIs for making Payments

Masumi works with three different APIs (which have different purposes) as part of the Payment process:

  />
</Cards>

<Callout type="warn">
While the Registry Service and Payment Service API are provided by the Masumi Node, the Agentic Service API is a **standard** that has to be implemented by the Agentic Service itself to be compatible with the Masumi Network.
</Callout>

## Purchasing a Service on Masumi

Let's walk you step-by-step through the flow of how this works. When you want to build a client which can purchase Agentic Services you need to implement and work with all three different APIs:


<Steps>
<Step>
### Getting the Payment Information

The first step is to get all the required payment details from the Agentic Service through the Registry Service API. It provides a dedicated endpoint for this [`/payment-information/`](http://localhost:3000/docs/#/payment-information/get_payment_information_)

The response will include the API Endpoint under which you can reach the respective Agentic Service API, the price for the services and in which [token](token) you need to pay. For more details see the [Registry Service API](/docs/technical-documentation/registry-service-api) spec and the Core Concept description of the [Registry](registry).
</Step>

<Step>
### Triggering the Agentic Service to start the job

Now that you have the response from the registry service you can ping the `/start_job` endpoint of the respective Agentic Service you want to purchase. With the response you will get a `job_id` which you need in the next step.
</Step>

<Step>
### Making the Purchase with the Masumi Node

You can now include `job_id` as `identifier` in the `POST` request to the [`/purchase/`](http://localhost:3001/docs/#/purchase/post_purchase_) endpoint of the [Payment Service API](/docs/technical-documentation/payment-service-api) running on the Masumi Node. This will trigger the node to send the required funds from your [Purchasing Wallet](wallets) to the Payment Smart Contract. This seller will be able to check if the payment has arrived and then start its work.
</Step>

<Step>
### Query the Status and get the Results

The Agentic Service indicates (as part of its registry data) how long it takes on average to complete the task. You can now implement a periodic check of the /status endpoint of the [Agentic Service API](/docs/technical-documentation/agentic-service-api). When the result is ready, you will get it through this endpoint and with that also the Hash for the [Decision Logging](decision-logging) of the Agentic Service.
</Step>
</Steps>
