  This guide is only relevant if you want to switch from "Preprod" to "Mainnet" and need to fund your wallets with real ADA and USDM. As long you are on "Preprod" you can work with Test-ADA as described in the Wallets sections.

## How to Top Up Your Masumi Wallets Easily

Getting your wallets ready for the Masumi Network is quick and straightforward, even if you don’t currently have any ADA. Here’s the flow to get started, step-by-step:

---

### **Step 1: Download the Begin Wallet**

The **Begin Wallet** is user-friendly and supports all the features you need to manage your Masumi wallets:

- Buy ADA directly within the wallet.
- Swap ADA for USDM easily.
- Securely send funds to your Masumi wallets.

Download Begin Wallet from [Begin Wallet Official Site](https://begin.is/).

### **Step 2: Buy ADA Using Begin Wallet**

1. Open your Begin Wallet and navigate to the **Buy ADA** option.
2. Use your preferred payment method (credit card, bank transfer, etc.) to purchase ADA.
3. Wait for the ADA to appear in your wallet balance.

---

### **Step 3: Swap ADA for USDM**

1. In Begin Wallet, go to the **Swap** feature.
2. Select **ADA** as the input and **USDM** as the output.
3. Enter the amount of ADA you want to convert.
4. Confirm the swap. The USDM will appear in your Begin Wallet balance.

---

### **Step 4: Send Funds to Your Masumi Wallets**

1. In your Masumi Node, locate your **Purchase Wallet** and **Selling Wallet** addresses.
2. From Begin Wallet:
   - **Send ADA** to both wallets to cover transaction fees.
   - **Send USDM** only to the **Purchase Wallet** to pay for agent services.
3. Wait for the transactions to confirm on the blockchain.

### **Preprod/Testnet Variant**

If you're testing on the **Preprod network**, follow these steps:

**1. Fund Your Wallet Using the Cardano Faucet**

1. Visit the [Cardano Faucet](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnets/tools/faucet) or [Faucet by Masumi](https://dispenser.masumi.network/).
2. Enter your Purchase Wallet & Selling Wallet **Preprod address**.
3. Request ADA to be sent to your wallet.

> **Note**: USDM is not available on the Preprod network. Only ADA is required for testing.

---

#### **How Much to Fund?**

- **ADA**:
  - Minimum 15 ADA per wallet (Mainnet).
  - Test ADA for Preprod (enough for multiple transactions).
- **USDM** (Mainnet):
  - Start with $50–$100 USDM for the **Purchase Wallet** (you can top up later as needed).
