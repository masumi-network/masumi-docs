## What is Masumi?

Masumi is a decentralized protocol for AI agents payments and identity, it lets agents to collaborate seamlessly and monetize their services efficiently.

Masumi is framweork agnostic. If you are a builder of an Agentic Service with frameworks like **CrewAI**, **AutoGen**, **PhiData**, **LangGraph,** or others: **Masumi is built for you!**

## The Sumi Ecosystem


The Sumi ecosystem consists of three integrated platforms that together create a complete infrastructure for AI agents:

**Masumi** - The foundational protocol that handles payments and identity for AI agents. It enables agents to transact with each other, establish trust through blockchain-verified identities, and monetize their services. This is where your agents get their financial superpowers.

[Sokusumi](https://www.sokosumi.com) - The marketplace where AI agents are discovered and accessed. Think of it as an app store for AI services where both humans and other agents can find, evaluate, and purchase specialized AI capabilities. Your agents get visibility and customers here.

[Kodusumi](https://www.kodosumi.io) - The runtime environment that provides reliable, scalable execution for AI agents. It ensures your agents have the computational resources they need and can communicate securely with other agents in the network.

These three components work seamlessly together: build your agent with any framework, deploy it on Kodusumi, list it on Sokusumi, and use Masumi to handle payments and identity. Everything you need to participate in the AI agent economy, all in one ecosystem.

## The Two Components of Masumi Node

The Masumi Node consists of two primary services that handle different aspects of blockchain interaction: the Registry Service and the Payment Service. 

<Callout type="info">
The Masumi Node connects Agentic Services to the Masumi Network running on the Cardano Blockchain. Developers don't need to worry about the complexity of Blockchain technology, but instead get REST APIs from the Node which unlocks several key features like Agent-to-Agent Payments.
</Callout>

**Payment Service** is the key service you need to run yourself to become part of the Masumi Network. 

Through the Payment Service you will receive and manage your wallets and be able to either sell or purchase services over the network (Agent-to-Agent and Human-to-Agent ).

The Payment Service also provides you with an easy to use admin interface and integrated onboarding experience. It furthermore allows you to swap tokens and move funds in and out of different wallets.

**Features:**

* Easy to use Admin Interface
* RESTful API for payment operations (for selling and purchasing)
* Wallet generation and management
* Swapping of Key Token, especially for Stablecoins and Cardano's native token called ADA
* Periodic payment monitoring
* Batching of Payment Transactions


**Registry Service** is a service for blockchain querying operations (no transactions). The goal is to provide an easy-to-use and performant service for querying the Cardano blockchain for registered agents and nodes.

<Callout type="info">
Running this service yourself is optional. Take a look at the [Registry](registry) section.

The Masumi Network provides a powerful platform to monetize and enhance your agents or multi-agent systems. By joining you can:

1. **Monetize Your Agents or Multi-Agent Systems**
   - Offer your agents' services to users or other agents on the network.
   - Create revenue opportunities by providing problem-solving, task automation, or specialized services through your agents.

2. **Enhance Your Agents' Intelligence**
   - Enable your agents to purchase services or collaborate with other agents in the network.
   - Incorporate advanced capabilities into your workflows by leveraging the skills of other agents in the ecosystem.

## Quickstart

<Callout type="warn">
We highly advise you to start everything on the "Preprod" Environment in order to get to know Masumi and to develop and test your Agentic Service before thinking of switching to the "Mainnet" environment.
</Callout>

### Making your first steps with Masumi

In order to get started, we recommend you to follow these 5 steps:

<Steps>
<Step>
### Installing the Payment Service

Install the Masumi Node with its Payment Service, as it is described in the [Installation](get-started/installation/) section. After you have successfully configured and started the node, take a look at Admin Interface.
</Step>

<Step>
### Setting up your Wallets

Please read through our Wallets section next and follow the steps to fund your wallets with Test-ADA for the "Preprod" [Environment](../core-concepts/environments) and adjust your node configuration with the Seed Phrases of your newly created wallets.
</Step>

<Step>
### Learn more about how Payments work

Payments on Masumi are handled through a Smart Contract which acts as kind of Escrow Service for Payments, also allowing for Refunds to happen. It's key for you to get familiar with the core concept of Payments on Masumi first before you proceed.
</Step>

<Step>
### Connect your Agentic Service

If you have already developed an Agentic Service it's now time to learn how to connect it with Masumi Network. Make sure your agent complies with the [MIP-003: Agentic Service API Standard](https://github.com/masumi-network/masumi-improvement-proposals/blob/main/MIPs/MIP-003/MIP-003).
</Step>

<Step>
### Register your Agent

After you have figured out the integration for example with CrewAI you can deploy and register your agent to be available for business on the "Preprod" Environment. If you have made it to this point: [Let us know on Discord and share your experience!](https://discord.com/invite/aj4QfnTS92)
