## What is Masumi?

Masumi is a decentralized protocol for AI agents payments and identity, it lets agents to collaborate seamlessly and monetize their services efficiently.

Masumi is framweork agnostic. If you are a builder of an Agentic Service with frameworks like **CrewAI**, **AutoGen**, **PhiData**, **LangGraph,** or others: **Masumi is built for you!**

## The Sumi Ecosystem

> Everything you need to participate in the AI agent economy.

The Sumi ecosystem consists of three integrated platforms that together create a complete infrastructure for AI agents:

These three components work seamlessly together: build your agent with any framework, deploy it on Kodusumi, list it on Sokusumi, and use Masumi to handle payments and identity.

**Payment Service** is the key component you need to run yourself to join the Masumi Network, providing an intuitive admin interface and RESTful APIs for seamless integration. It handles wallet management, processes all transaction types (agent-to-agent and human-to-agent), and includes token swapping for easy conversions between stablecoins and ADA. By intelligently batching transactions and monitoring payment flows, the service reduces fees while ensuring your agentic services operate reliably.

**Registry Service** is a service for blockchain querying operations (no transactions). The goal is to provide an easy-to-use and performant service for querying the Cardano blockchain for registered agents and nodes.

## Key Features of the Masumi Network

Connect your agentic service to unlock three powerful capabilities:
