## Railway Deployment

This example uses <a href="https://railway.com?referralCode=pa1ar" target="_blank">Railway</a> templates. 

Railway is a cloud development platform that enables developers to deploy, manage and scale applications and databases with minimal configuration.

Railway templates we provide are pointing to the open-source repositories of Masumi organisation. If you want to be extra careful, You can also fork the repositories first, and still use the templates by just pointing them to your forks. 

### Prerequisites

- <a href="https://blockfrost.io/" target="_blank">Blockfrost</a> API key
- <a href="https://railway.com?referralCode=pa1ar" target="_blank">Railway account</a> (free trial is 30 days or $5)

### How to Deploy

1. **Deploy <a href="https://github.com/masumi-network/masumi-payment-service" target="_blank">Masumi Payment Service</a>**:  

    [![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/masumi-payment-service-official?referralCode=padierfind)
   - Use the template in an existing or new project (in existing project, "Create" > "Template" > search for "Masumi Payment Service")
   - Provide Blockfrost API key in variables (required to click "deploy")
   - Click on deploy, watch the logs, wait for it (takes 5+ minutes, depending on the load on Railway)
   - You should see 2 services on your canvas, connected with an dotted arrow: a PostgreSQL database and a Masumi Payment Service.
   - Click on Masumi Payment Service on the canvas > Settings > Networking > Generate URL
   - Test at public URL `/admin` or `/docs`. Your default admin key (used to login to the admin panel and sign transactions) is in your variables. **Change it on the admin panel.**
   - **Important:** Masumi API endpoints must include `/api/v1/`!  Be sure to append that slugs in the next steps (deploying agentic service).

2. **Deploy <a href="https://github.com/masumi-network/agentic-service-wrapper" target="_blank">Agent Service API Wrapper</a>**:  

    [![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/masumi-compliant-service-api-official?referralCode=padierfind)
   - Make sure your Masumi payment service is up and running
   - Provide `PAYMENT_SERVICE_URL` in variables (format: `https://your-instance-of-masumi.up.railway.app/api/v1`, the main part of the URL can differ, point is - don't forget the `/api/v1` slugs)
   - Provide `PAYMENT_API_KEY` (your Masumi Payment Service Admin Key)
   - Provide `SELLER_VKEY` that you can find in the admin panel by clicking on your Selling wallet , or by calling the GET /payment-source/ endpoint of your deployed Masumi Payment Service. 
   - Wait for deployment to complete
   - Generate public URL in settings of the service
   - Check the swagger at `/docs`

3. **Register Agent on Masumi**
   - Go to Payment Service admin panel, top up selling wallet (you can use <a href="https://dispenser.masumi.network/"target="_blank">Masumi tADA dispencer</a>)
   - Register agent via Agent Service URL (you need to have funds on your selling wallet)
   - Retrieve Agent ID aka Asset ID

4. **Test Integration**
   - Start job via Agent Service
   - Copy job output (excluding `job_id` and `payment_id`)
   - Go to the `/docs` of your Masumi Payment Service
   - Open POST `/purchase` on Payment Service and paste your job output (this initiates the payment process)
   - Check job status on Agent Service for results

## How to Customize

1. Fork this <a href="https://github.com/masumi-network/agentic-service-wrapper" target="_blank">repository</a>
2. Edit `agentic_service.py` to implement your agent logic
3. Update `input_schema` in main.py to match your input requirements
4. Run or deploy your customized version using the Railway (you will just need to replace the repository in settings of the service to point to your fork).

> **Side note:** Railway can try to deploy public repository without asking for any permissions. To deploy a private repository, you need to connect Railway to your GitHub account or GitHub organisation and grant reading permissions (you will be guided through the process by Railway).

## Local Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit .env with your config

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip sync requirements.txt
python get_payment_source_info.py
``` 

Add SELLER_VKEY to .env

```bash
python main.py api
```

## API Endpoints

### `/start_job` - Start a new job

curl http://localhost:8000/availability
curl http://localhost:8000/input_schema

# start a job (Masumi Network format)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/start_job \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input_data": [{"key": "input_string", "value": "Hello World"}]}'
