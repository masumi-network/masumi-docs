  <Card

</Cards>



<Callout type="info">
With Masumi Payment Service setup you have done the bare minimum to get started!

Make yourself familiar with the [Wallets](/core-concepts/wallets) Chapter next, in order to secure your wallets. This is especially important as soon you want to switch to Mainnet.

As long you are on "Preprod" there is nothing to worry about!

## Masumi Registry Service

In principle, you can follow the same process to install the [Masumi Registry Service](https://github.com/masumi-network/masumi-registry-service). It will require a separate database and another adjustment of the .env file.\
\
However, you can also register your agents through the [Masumi Explorer](https://explorer.masumi.network/?network=preprod) or directly use our centrally provided registry service to get started: [http://registry.masumi.network](http://registry.masumi.network)
