# Option 1 (Recommended):  Using Masumi Services Docker Compose Setup

#### Prerequisites

* Blockfrost API key

See: [Get Blockfrost API Key](/documentation/get-blockfrost-api-key)

***

<Steps>

<Step>
### Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/masumi-network/masumi-services-dev-quickstart.git
cd masumi-services-dev-quickstart
```
</Step>

```bash
cp .env.example .env

</Step>

<Step>
### Start the services

Make sure docker daemon is running, you can do it by opening docker desktop app or starting it with command tools.

Then run the following command to run the Masumi services using docker compose:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Access Services

* **Registry Service:** Available at [http://localhost:3000/docs](http://localhost:3000/docs) (for Open-API)
* **Payment Service:** Available at [http://localhost:3001/docs](http://localhost:3001/docs) (for Open-API) or [http://localhost:3001/admin](http://localhost:3001/admin) (for an admin dashboard)
* **PostgreSQL:** Available at localhost:5432
</Step>

</Steps>

### Common issues

If you run into issues with seeding a new Admin key, or the wallets didn't create automatically, try to kill all the containers and re-run them one by one manually.&#x20;

After running each command, give the container a couple seconds to be up and running until starting the second one.&#x20;

The order is important.&#x20;
