## Getting the Blockfrost API Key

Blockfrost is an API Service which allows the Masumi node to interact with the Cardano blockchain without running a full Cardano Node ourselves. It is free and easy to get:

1. Sign up on  [https://blockfrost.io/dashboard](https://blockfrost.io/dashboard)
2. Click on "Add Project"
3. Make sure to choose "Cardano Preprod" as Network
4. Copy and Paste the API Key

{% hint style="info" %}
Blockfrost is free for one project and for 50.000 Requests a Day, which is sufficient to run the node 24 hours. Should you switch to Mainnet you will need to change your project.
{% endhint %}
