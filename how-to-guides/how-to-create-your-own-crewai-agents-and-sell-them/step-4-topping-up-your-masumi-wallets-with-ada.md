# Step 4: Topping up your Masumi Wallets with ADA

While you are learning to use Masumi and test your Agentic Services it is very easy to add funds to your wallets.&#x20;

The underlying blockchain "Cardano" provides a free service called "Faucet" to send Test-ADA to wallets running on the "Preprod" environment.

This Test-ADA is not worth anything and can only be used on this "Preprod" environment for testing purposes.

### 1. Open the Admin Dashboard

* Open the Admin Dashboard: [http://localhost:3001/admin/](http://localhost:3001/admin/)
* Navigate to the PREPROD Contract under "Contracts"
* Scroll down to the "**Selling Wallet**"
* Click on the "Copy" icon next to the wallet address
* Click on the "Top up" button, which sends you the [Cardano Faucet](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnets/tools/faucet)
